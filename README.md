# Conformal Regression for Linear Regression 

## **Aim:**
To develop a reliable regression model that provides not only point predictions but also valid predictio intervals, using conformal prediction methods to quantify uncertainty. 

## **Objectives:**
- To implement linear regression models on a synthetic dataset using train-test split and cross-validation.
- To apply conformal prediction techniques to generate distribution-free prediction intervals.
- To evaluate the performance of the prediction intervals using empirical coverage and average interval length. 
- To compare the effectiveness of split conformal and cross-validation conformal approaches.
